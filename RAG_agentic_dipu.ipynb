      "mechanics\n",
      "David Morin, morin@physics.harvard.edu\n",
      "This chapter gives a brief introduction to quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics can be\n",
      "thought of roughly as the study of physics on very small length scales, although there are\n",
      "also certain macroscopic systems it directly applies to. The descriptor \\quantum\" arises\n",
      "because in contrast with classical mechanics, certain quantities take on only discrete values.\n",
      "However, some quantities still take on continuous values, as we'll see.\n",
      "In quantum mechanics, particles have wavelike properties, and a particular wave equa-\n",
      "tion, the Schrodinger equation , governs how these waves behave. The Schrodinger equation\n",
      "is di®erent in a few ways from the other wave equations we've seen in this book. But these\n",
      "di®erences won't keep us from applying all of our usual strategies for solving a wave equation\n",
      "and dealing with the resulting solutions.\n",
      "In some respect, quantum mechanics is just another example of a system governed by a\n",
      "wave equation. In fact, we will ¯nd below that some quantum mechanical systems have exact\n",
      "analogies to systems we've already studied in this book. So the results can be carried over,\n",
      "with no modi¯cations whatsoever needed. However, although it is fairly straightforward\n",
      "to deal with the actual waves, there are many things about quantum mechanics that are a\n",
      "combination of subtle, perplexing, and bizarre. To name a few: the measurement problem,\n",
      "hidden variables along with Bell's theorem, and wave-particle duality. You'll learn all about\n",
      "these in an actual course on quantum mechanics.\n",
      "Even though there are many things that are highly confusing about quantum mechanics,\n",
      "the nice thing is that it's relatively easy to apply quantum mechanics to a physical system\n",
      "to ¯gure out how it behaves. There is fortunately no need to understand all of the subtleties\n",
      "about quantum mechanics in order to use it. Of course, in most cases this isn't the best\n",
      "strategy to take; it's usually not a good idea to blindly forge ahead with something if you\n",
      "don't understand what you're actually working with. But this lack of understanding can\n",
      "be forgiven in the case of quantum mechanics, because no one really understands it. (Well,\n",
      "maybe a couple people do, but they're few and far between.) If the world waited to use\n",
      "quantum mechanics until it understood it, then we'd be stuck back in the 1920's. The\n",
      "bottom line is that quantum mechanics can be used to make predictions that are consistent\n",
      "with experiment. It hasn't failed us yet. So it would be foolish not to use it.\n",
      "The main purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how similar certain results in quan-\n",
      "tum mechanics are to earlier results we've derived in the book. You actually know a good\n",
      "12 CHAPTER 10. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS\n",
      "deal of quantum mechanics already, whether you realize it or not.\n",
      "The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Section 10.1 we give a brief history of the\n",
      "development of quantum mechanics. In Section 10.2 we write down, after some motivation,\n",
      "theSchrodinger wave equation , both the time-dependent and time-independent forms. In\n",
      "Section 10.3 we discuss a number of examples. The most important thing to take away from\n",
      "this section is that all of the examples we discuss have exact analogies in the string/spring\n",
      "systems earlier in the book. So we technically won't have to solve anything new here. All\n",
      "the work has been done before. The only thing new that we'll have to do is interpret the old\n",
      "results. In Section 10.4 we discuss the uncertainty principle . As in Section 10.3, we'll ¯nd\n",
      "that we already did the necessary work earlier in the book. The uncertainty principle turns\n",
      "out to be a direct consequence of a result from Fourier analysis. But the interpretation of\n",
      "this result as an uncertainty principle has profound implications in quantum mechanics.\n",
      "10.1 A brief history\n",
      "Before discussing the Schrodinger wave equation, let's take a brief (and by no means com-\n",
      "prehensive) look at the historical timeline of how quantum mechanics came about. The\n",
      "actual history is of course never as clean as an outline like this suggests, but we can at least\n",
      "get a general idea of how things proceeded.\n",
